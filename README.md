# AUDIO-DSP-
Audio processing algorithms in C++ 
Welcome!

A collection of audio algorithms I made during my two weeks off in December 2019. 
As this were originally intended for personal and study purposes, you'll find that documentation is scarce and comments are a mix of spanish and english. As I didn't reinvent the wheel in any topic, I didn't feel the particular need to spend any more time than the necessary for hearing the results.

For realtime projects, refer to the REALTIME folder, though you'll need the Portaudio library
For non-realtime (though *very* easily done so) refer to the root files. You'll need the Audiofile library.
