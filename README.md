Audio processing algorithms in C++ 
Use: Write program in exe.cpp --> Compile exe.cpp --> Execute

A collection of audio algorithms I made for self study during school breaks. 
As this is intended for personal and study purposes, documentation is scarce and comments are mostly a collection of self-notes. It's my personal playground. These are mostly testing programs, serving as previous steps for VST plugin development. Not uploading Realtime audio anymore since it depends on external libraries
