Audio processing algorithms in C++ 

A collection of audio algorithms I made during my two weeks off in December 2019. 
As this were originally intended for personal and study purposes, you'll find that documentation is scarce and comments are a mix of spanish and english. As I didn't reinvent the wheel in any of these topics, I didn't feel the need to pursue documentation after hearing the programs worked. 


-For examples of how to start with realtime audio processing projects (reading and writing to buffers) refer to the REALTIME folder. You'll need the Portaudio library.
-For non-realtime (though *very* easily done so) refer to the root files. You'll need the Audiofile library.
